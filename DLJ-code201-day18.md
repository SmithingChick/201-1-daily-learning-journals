The problem with doing these things a few days later is that I have to remember which day this was. I think it was Wednesday.

Wednesday was a challenge. I got sick on Tuesday night so I opted to work remotely on Wednesday as I was still pretty wiped out. I kept in contact with my group partners via Slack. It was an interesting experience. Mostly I learned that I'd really rather work with people face-to-face. I definitely would rather work with this group face-to-face. They weren't inclined to listen to me when I was sitting in the same room as them, they were even less likely when I was just on their computer screens. :-\

<h3>Addendum:</h3>
I want to add some things to this journal since we don't do journals on Days 19/20 & some things happened on Thursday & Friday that illustrate the communication issues I've had with my group. I'm not sure that the right place to bring up these concerns is the Individual project submission form. I feel like there, it'd just come across as bitching & making excuses. ON the other hand, I also know the importance of documenting problems in order to fix them. Admittedly, it's too late to fix this project but I'm hopeful that there might be a way to avoid similar problems in the future. 

First, I talked about finally getting started on the CSS on the website after lunch on Thursday as I'd done everything else I could with the coding on my event tree. Caitlin argued with me, saying there was more to do on the JS & pointed to some notes we had up on the board regarding our results page. I explained several times that I could still participate in the conversation regarding the page but since Tyler was writing most of the script (& of the 3 of us, I felt my JS abilities were the weakest), there wasn't anything I could really do. We couldn't have more than one person writing the script itself because there would have been all kinds of merge conflicts. Plus, I was supposed to be styling the tree pages with the JS-generated tree pages & that was going to take some work. Grudging, she finally saw my point. For some reason, she kept commenting that she didn't have Photoshop, which wasn't particularly relevant to the discussion. I have CS6 but again, there wasn't any reason for that to be an issue as the only graphic I'd said I would create was a logo that got dumped when they renamed the project. 

Every time I brought up the importance of Caitlin & I working together on design so our site would have a consistant look, she kept insisting that we could each create our own CSS for our own pages & just let them be different or merge them together on Friday morning. I tried to explain that her plan wasn't going to work the way she thought it was but again, she wouldn't listen. Both She & Tyler kept insisting that function was more important than design & I kept trying to get them to understand that design is integral to a properly-functioning website. (Given that my point was beuatifully demonstrated by the other 2 groups projects, I hope they now understand that)

While we worked that afternoon, Caitlin & Tyler sat next to eachother on the couch & talked quietly while I sat on the comfy chair at the end. I was not included in their discussions & couldn't even hear what they were saying for the most part. I assumed that if what they were talking about was relevant to all of us that they'd talk to me about it. By that point, I'd made several direct comments about including me in relevant conversations & had told them how much of a problem it was that they'd made so many decisions without even telling me, let alone including me in the discussion. When Caitlin left, I mentioned to Tyler that I felt like Caitlin was communicating with me at all. He just kind of shrugged it off & said that she'd used the color pallette we'd agreed on earlier.

As I mentioned, one of my jobs was to style the JS-genearted screen pages. Knowing that this was more important to my partners than what the index page looked like, I made it my priority. And for some reason, it wasn't working properly. I tried all the tricks I could think of to get it work & nothing would. I ended up staying up all night trying to get it going without any kind of success. According to Slack, neither Tyler nor Caitlin were online for me to talk to. This turned out to be wrong, as they had been on & had talked a bit. I can only assume something was up with my internet connection at home. I also keep checking to see if either of them had pushed up any file changes to Github. 

Friday morning, I gave them the bad news that I hadn't been able to get the CSS to work on the tree page, despite working all night. And when I opened my laptop, that's when their Slack comments from the pervious night showed up, & I told them I hadn't seen them, although there wasn't really any discussion of their work on the pages. Tylor finally figured out that the reason the CSS didn't work on the tree pages was because the JS wasn't generating the proper tags, not because of any issues with the CSS itself (which honestly hadn't occured to me) & we set about fixing it on both his tree page & mine. 

Caitlin finally pushed up her pages from the day before up to Github on Friday morning, where I discovered that she'd completely changed the entire layout again including changing to all-new fonts & a CSS-generated logo but expected me to leave my pages as they were. I told them flat out that that option was not acceptable & that it made our site look like the pages weren't even from the same site (which was true), which would definitely affect our grade. /when I said that her design looked nothing like the wireframe we'd discussed previously, she claimed not to know that there was a wireframe. I pointed out that she was there when I drew it out, that we'd talked about it & agreed to it & we did it at the same time Tyler had wireframed the tree pages. 

At this point, I sent Aaron a private message on Slack asking if I could just quit because I was so frustrated. Instead, he told me to come talk to him & he helped me work out some of the issues in combining elements of Caitlin's design with my pages on the site, at least generally. Not all of it worked. After lunch, I tried to get her entire logo coded into the index & branch pages but that was an utter disaster. 

Incidentally, while we were getting our thoughts together for the presentation, Tyler commented that our group had issues with communication, to which I responded with an extremely sarcastic, "Gee, ya' think?" He missed the sarcasm. (I'm not really sure how, given that the only thing more obvious would have been if I'd had a glowing neon sign above my head but that's neither here nor there. I did tell him to read my shirt, as I happened to be wearing my Irish Sarcasm Society t-shirt -- slogan: <i>"Like we need your support"</i> -- & that I was being sarcastic.) I was surprised he mentioned it, given that he was part of the lack of communication.

Eventually, I'll go back & look at it to see what went wrong & how to fix it for my own personal knowledge but I currently need to resubmit my own project assignments & those take priority.
