What a wonderful feeling to actually have my code project almost entirely done for class! Rita was a huge help to me on Monday night, answering my coding questions through slack. The solution we came up with was the same one Aaron gave during the code review. Validation!

Sadly, the chart's a bit trickier. All the various settings & such are much more complicated.
