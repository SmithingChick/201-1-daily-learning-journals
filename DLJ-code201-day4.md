<h1># LJ Code 201 - Day 4</h1>

<p>OK, I am feeling much better about my coding abilities today. Also my ability to brain. Yay!</p>

<p>One thing I learned today is that we can actually submit that we've done the readings in Canvas. I'd tried last week when I read the first bunch of chapters but there wasn't a way to do it. I didn't know that had changed. So, I need to get caught up on all of them.

I feel very lucky that I got paired up with Tyler for the Pair Coding assignment. He really knows what he's doing with JS so he could really help me out with the things I was having problems with. It seems that a big part of my problem is that I was over-thinking the code. Calling a function really is as easy as function(); It's hilariously ironic. My students constantly overthought their metals projects. The difference is that they were always surprised when I told them an easier way to do it. They seemed to think that I <em>wanted</em> them to do it the hard way. Silly students!

I know that yesterday's angst & frustration was in my head & not what other people thought. Just a bad day. So long as I actually am accomplishing things, I usually bounce back pretty quickly. One thing that i think will help is if I don't worry so much about trying to keep up with all the code Aaron types up during his lectures & pay more attention to what he's saying. And take good notes.

Really, really good notes.
