Some day my chart will come...


So, I figured out one of my problems with the chart-- I had somehow missed creating a drawChart function. Kinda hard for a chart to appear when you haven't told it to.

I also worked a bit with David the JS Guru from 401 as well as some of my fellow classmates & have been working through various errors, mostly involving things which the console tells me are either undefined (despite appearing to be defined properly) or are somehow 'null'. Oh, and one that turned out to be a problem in my html. I somehow managed to delete the link to canvas-chartJS without knwoing it. Personally, I blame the pixies living in my computer.

And I still have no chart. But at least it's trying to generate one now, so that's something.
Some of us are going to get together this weekend to try to get ourselves caught up. I'm hoping that'll really help.


On the other hand, CSS animators are soooo much fun! I'm grouped with Tyler & Caitlyn for the final project & we're thinking of ways of incorporating animations into our project.
