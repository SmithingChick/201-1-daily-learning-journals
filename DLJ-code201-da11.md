Totay was better. For one thing, I actually felt like I had a vague understanding of what I"m supposed to be doing. For another, Aaron made a point to talk to me about my progress & introduced me to David, the TA from the 401 class, who can also help me with JavaScript. And Rita popped up online tonight & helped me considerably. Difficult classes are always easier to deal with  when you know the instructors are rooting for you, too.

Amusingly, I'm still trying to figure out the same question I had when I left clas this afternoon but it turned out that there were a few more steps I need to cover before I got there. Still, one last puzzle to solve & it's done!  Well, OK, not <em>done</em> done but today's coding assignment will be & that's something.
