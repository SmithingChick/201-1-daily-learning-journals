Did we miss a day? Or 3? I think our last learning journal assignment was Day 14. Perhaps I missed some. I've been behind on just about everything else & am currently even behind on these. :-\

So, today we began our group project for the final. Aaron seems to think our project is going to be far more complicated than we realized. Maybe we should have gone with Tyler's idea about doing a game. I'd suggested doing a web-based version of my Conspiracy Dice Game but didn't push it because it is after all a real game that I'm planning on publishing for real at some point & it occured to me that doing such a project might cause problems down the road from a professional standpoint.

I can't seem to get my partners to understand that designing how the site is going to look is just as crucial to its functionality as whether the JavaScript works. This concerns me & I think it's going to cause problems.
