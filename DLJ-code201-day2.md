Well, I was much less exhausted today as compared to yesterday, so that's a good sign.  :-D

And I learned that if I get hung up on a step during the lecture portion, I should just stop & listen, then worry about catching up. Otherwise, I might miss too much of the lecture. Then I really have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing.

I had fun playing with CSS, though. I think I'm the only person in the class that actually likes it. But I really do-- sooo meany design possibilities! When I did web design 10 years ago, CSS was just becoming a thing but I wasn't allowed to use it on the site I worked on. I had to lay out everything in tables & create little transparent boxes to put graphics where I wanted them. One of the things I find ironic about web design now is that a lot of web sites then had more interesting layouts than the majority of what's out there now. So many sites are all laid out like newspapers, which gets visually boring very quickly.

My major disappointment for the day is that I didn't know how to make my javascript check the answers to the quiz to make sure they were yes/no answers. I'll figure it out eventually.
