Day 9

Today was a much better day. Aaron spent a fair amount of time waking me through various portions of the code during the afternoon lab which was a <strong>huge</strong> help. Plus, I'm finally cluing into the fact that it's OK to look at how other people have solved the same issues. Typical academic problem-- anything even close to copying someone else's work is plagerism & will end your career. But I m getting better about asking my fellow classmates for help.

I'd still rather work on the design part, though. But I did confirm that I really do need to set a time if I want to use it as an incentive. I spent more time after class working on the design than I did my script. :-\
