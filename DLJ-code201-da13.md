Today I learned that I need to write more notes.

Yesterday, Aaron put the code he worked on in class up on the class repo so we could all still look at it later. Since I thought he was going to do the same thing today, I tried to keep up with typing out all the code. Which left me with some confusing half-written code at the end. Tyler let me look at his code to see if I could figure out the rest of the parts I missed but he's set things up a bit differently. 

Much as I enjoyed the presentation this afternoon, I'm kinda thinking maybe I should have holed up in the corner room with David the JS guru for the duration like some o fmy classmates did. I shall do so on Thursday. Plus, it seems some of us are going to try to get together after class on Thursday to work together on our projects, so that should help me get back on track.
