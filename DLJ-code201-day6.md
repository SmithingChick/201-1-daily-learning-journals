I will never forget my power cord again. Ye Gods.

It's much harder to deal with code issues when you can't ask for anyone for help right then & there. Admittedly, I could have asked on Slack & I'd planned to, except that after I plugged in my laptop so it could charge, I sat down to review the relevant chapters in the JavaScript book & promptly fell asleep on the couch. That's particularly impressive when you take into account that there was a team of guys putting up new gutters right outside the windows. (I do seem to have developed a knack for self-sabatoge on occasion).
