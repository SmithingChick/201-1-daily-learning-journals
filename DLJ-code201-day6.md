I will never forget my power cord again. Ye Gods.

It's much harder to deal with code issues when you can't ask for anyone for help right then & there. Admittedly, I could have asked on Slack & I'd planned to, except that after I plugged in my laptop so it could charge, I sat down to review the relevant chapters in the JavaScript book & promptly fell asleep on the couch. That's particularly impressive when you take into account that there was a team of guys putting up new gutters right outside the windows. (I'm not self-destructive like I was when I was younger but I do seem to have developed a knack for self-sabatoge). 



Oh, I feel like I should mention something. One of the reasons I think I'm struggling with JavaScript is the fact that I actually have to work to understand it. I'm one of those weirdos who didn't have to study & could still get straight A's. So, keep that in mind when I complain about having trouble with it.
