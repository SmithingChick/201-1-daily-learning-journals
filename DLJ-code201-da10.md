Friday was actually kinda fun-- and not just because a bunch of us went out for a beer afterwards.

The pair programing project was right up my alley with it being entirely CSS/Design based, Chris & I did really well for the most part. Good communication is key! Which is why we didn't run into trouble until the end, when we were rushing to get done & accidentally ended up working on the same part. Merge conflict! Up until then, we'd seperated out our tasks by who could do them most quickly & it went really smoothly.  I'm really going to have to look up how to do the horizontal line with the graphic in the middle, though. That's one I don't know & the code I found for it didn't work quite right. I cheated with the project, having the little graphic overlap the line using a negative margin but it's bugging me that it's not right. Plus, it's a pretty nifty trick. 

Now if I could just figure out why the CSS on my Salmon Cookies page won't work properly...
