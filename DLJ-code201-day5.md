First off, I managed to be late withOUT gettign super flustered. Yay me!  :-)  I think it helped that Aaron was going over CCS when I came in, which I've got a pretty good grasp of.  I really appreciate Lisa taking notes, though. She's awesome!

The afternoon coding problems were something. As usual, I ran into the issue of missing soemthing dumb that took me 15 minutes to figure out (like forgetting to call the function in one. Tyler suggested make console.log notations so I'd know which parts of the code were working, which was incredibly helpful. I could focus on that parts that were hinky without messing up good code. The bug in question 3 seemed a bit unfair. The question was tricky enough without having the testing code not work in the first place. 

But, with a bit of help from my classmates, I did manage to figure them all out. Yay! 

My confidence over the last couple of days is growing. The better the grip I get on JavaScript, the better I feel.
