# DLJ Code 201 - Day 1

I can't just call it LJ anything. I used to blog on Live Journal & those initials will remain forever embedded in my mind as Live Journal. You probably don't want me ranting about politics in these journals, no matter how amusing I can be on the subject.  :-D

I learned quite a bit on how to use Git & got more familar with Atom. It's been years since I've dealt with Terminal/command line (and by "years" I think I mean nearly 2 decades. When did Microsoft switch from MS DOS to Windows?)  I'm not particularly familiar with Git Bash & I'd never used Atom before. I've always done my web coding in Dreamweaver & when I started trying to code in a text editor, I used Sublime Text 2. I'm still trying to get my head around this crazy packet things. 

Otherwise, this was a review of really basic HTML & JavaScript things I'm already familiar with. That's going to change quickly with JavaScript since I don't entirely know what I'm doing there.
