So, I feel like I'm starting to get some things but not others. I did find myself relieved to discover that I'm not the only one behind on this week's project, though. It just seems like we're going through all these JS codes & concepts super fast while not doing nearly as much with html & css, which I'm much more familiar with. It's like everything's reversed. It didn't help that I kept getting merge errors for reasons I'm still not clear on.

So, still grinding away. I'm organizing a study session after class on Thursday with myself, Risa so we can get help from our more JS-savvy classmates like Tyler to help us get caught up & learn from the more knowledgable. I told them in exchange I'd happily critique their layouts & such. And then I told them I'd do that anyways (I am a fully qualified art prof after all. If there's anything I know, it's how to run a crit.)

Meanwhile, as I keep getting hung up on the scripting, I have been working on a style guide for the site. I've got a generic style guide template set up in InDesign that I use for all of my web & graphic design projects. Once it's done, I'll be sure to convert it to pdf & upload it as part of my final project.
